# Names

How each tool and product is written in a script and how a viewer sees it: in the captions, on the frames and
in the player. One row a name. The script says a name however reads best aloud (the narration is never
re-voiced for a spelling); the captions show it as this table does (`captions-sentences`), and `check-terms`
warns on a frame that shows it another way.

- **Shown in backticks** is a tool's name or a command: it is shown in code markup (the frames' mono, a chip in
  the captions), in its own spelling, wherever it appears, never capitalised ("reelplanning" at the start of a
  sentence is still `reelplanning`). Its next words, when the script says them, join the chip:
  `reel status`, `npm test`, `claude -p`.
- **Shown plain** is a product or an acronym, shown with that case and no markup: GitHub, CLI, JSON.
- A real thing on screen (inside a `data-artifact`) keeps its own text, and a word inside a path or a command
  line (`bin/reelplanning.mjs`) is part of it.
- A flag, a path or a file name (`-p`, `--dry-run`, `/work`, `plan.md`) is written in the script as it is
  written, and is code in the captions whether listed or not; `narrate` hands the voice its spoken form
  ("dash p", "plan dot md", `scripts/lib/say.mjs`). An old script that spells one out ("claude dash p") is
  shown written in the captions, and `check-terms` warns on it.

Add a row when a plan brings in a tool the videos name. Written lists the spellings to catch, commas between.
